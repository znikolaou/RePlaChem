--------------------------

This directory contains a working example for the reduction
of a large-scale plasma methane chemical mechanism. 

./input/ 

 Contains the chemical mechanism file (kinet11.txt)

./input/rates/case*/ 

 Contains the reaction rates. 

control.txt 

 Contains the user-specified reduction parameters. 

./output/

 Where data is written. 

*When performing your own reduction, it is best to create
a working directory different from the installation directory
and adding the redChem executable to your PATH.
