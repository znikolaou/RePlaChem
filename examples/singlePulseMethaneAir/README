--------------------------

This directory contains a working example for the reduction
of a large-scale chemical mechanism. 

./input/ 
--------
Contains the chemical mechanism file (kinet11.txt)

./input/rates/case*/ 
--------------------
Contains the reaction rates. 

control.txt 
-----------
User-specified reduction parameters. 

./output/
--------
Where results are written. 

*When performing your own reduction, it is best to create
a working directory different from the installation directory
of plasRedChem and add the redChem executable to your PATH.
