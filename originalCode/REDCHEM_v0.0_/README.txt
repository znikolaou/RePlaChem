!     DESCRIPTION:
! 
!     <REDCHEM_v0.0> can be used for generating skeletal chemical 
!     mechanisms from detailed chemical mechanisms. The code requires 
!     input data from a 0-D initial-value problem.
!
!     Instructions:
!
!     1. Prepare input data for each case. Save in ./input 
!
!     2. Edit ./input/target.txt file. 
!
!     3. Provide mechanism and species files in KPP format 
!        in ./input: REACTIONS.eqn, SPECIES.spc
!
!     4. make clean
!
!     5. make goredchem
!
!     6. ./goredchem.sh
